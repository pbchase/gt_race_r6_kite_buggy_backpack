Make a custom dogbone to connect the bladder to the loop of the center hanger. Turn the wood according to @fig-dogbone-diagram Sand the whole piece but pay special attention to the tapered end and the cylindrical 8mm diameter section. That will assure the dogbone can slide in and back out with ease.
