The backpack is designed to provide both gear storage and accommodations for a three liter water bladder. It incorporates simple folded flap closures to provide easy access while minimize dirt and water intrusion. It also provide a dirt-out feature on each of its two pouches to allow send to fall away from the stored gear and be easily removed. A large pouch the full width of backplate of the buggy holds the water bladder while providing ample additional room for a gear. A smaller pouch attached to the back of the main pouch is large enough to hold a small cell phone.
