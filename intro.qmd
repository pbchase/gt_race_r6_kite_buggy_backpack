# Introduction

This is a book a guide for building a backpack for the GT-Race R6 kite buggy designed and built by Martin Faber (see http://www.gt-race.nl/). While Martin designs and builds the buggy, the backpack is designed by Philip Chase, Errol Hartbarger, and Susan Chase.

The backpack is designed to provide both gear storage and accommodations for a three liter water bladder. It incorporates simple folded flap closures to provide easy access while minimizing dirt and water intrusion. It also provides a dirt-out feature on each of its two pouches to allow sand to fall away from the stored gear and be easily removed. A large pouch the full width of buggy's back plate holds the water bladder while providing ample additional room for gear. A smaller pouch attached to the back of the main pouch is large enough to hold a large mobile phone.
