The body of the backpack is a long tube open on both ends. The bottom of this tube has a full with hook-and-loop closure. Above that is a false floor made of mesh. The mesh floor and the full-width hook-and-loop closure allow sand and other debris to fall away from the compartment and be easily removed. The dirt out includes a nylon flap that can be pulled out of the opening to prevent the hook-and-loop closure from re-closing while cleaning.

Above the mesh floor is the main storage area of the backpack. This area holds a 3 L water bladder. The backpack is designed specifically around the [3 Liter HydraulicsÂ® Reservoir](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/3-liter-hydraulics-reservoir-3LRES_649.html) from [Osprey](https://www.osprey.com). This bladder is designed to be hung from the upper clip, so the backpack is designed accordingly. The water bladder is hung in the center of the main storage area. It occupies about 1/2 the width of this compartment allowing for additional storage left and right of the bladder as well as on top of the bladder.

The upper portion of the tube is folded down to form a flap closure for the backpack. The flap is tri-folded, then folded down and clip to an adjustable strap attached to the rear axle.

## Hose routing

The backpack provides routes out the top of the backpack for the water bladder's hose. The routes are at the top of the backpack left and right of the center line. The two routes support the bladder's option to route the hose up the left or right side of the bladder. Each route has a draw string to seal the opening tightly around the hose to reduce the risk of water and sand intrusion.

The free end of the hose needs to be readily available to the pilot. Osprey's bladder hoses include a magnet that can be used to tether the bit-valve end of the hose with a second magnet. To coordinate with this, the buggy can be equipped with one or more magnets along the frame on the pilot's preferred side for the hose.
