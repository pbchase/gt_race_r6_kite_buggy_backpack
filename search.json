    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nI had my first ride in a kite buggy July 4, 1992. My ride was a Peter Lynn buggy. That was so early in buggy history I don’t even think it had a model. Later I bought a Peter Lynn Comp buggy, then another of the same. In maybe 2009, I bought a Peter Lynn XR+ and then a Flexifoil buggy. I never had a great way to carry tools, water, or any other gear. In 2014 I purchased a hydration backpack, but it was too small to carry anything but water. I would tie tools to the buggy frame just so I could tighten a loose bolt if my buggy came undone away from camp. Sometimes I would lose a wrench or a ground stake while riding and never find it again. After each session I had to hose and dry my wrenches to keep the from seizing up with sand and corrosion.\nIn the Summer of 2021, I finally purchased a decent hydration backpack that could carry my water and just enough gear. It had room for a few wrenches, a multi-tool, a line set, a fid, spar pocket repair supplies, repair tape, my car keys and a phone. The backpack held everything and it could keep everything dry. I finally had a enough tools and parts on me I could break down miles from camp and probably fly home. It was a model from Osprey and I loved it. I used it every time I went buggying and it served very well. I was thrilled to have finally solved my gear management problem.\nYet a year later I upended that happy world when I placed an order for a really nice buggy. I wanted a buggy with a broader wheel base, larger wheel diameter, hip-lock, and better frame geometry. So I ordered a GT-Race R6 from Martin Faber. While I was waiting for Martin to build it, I realized my fancy Osprey backpack would never work on this modern, high-backed buggy. I began searching for a solution and decided the best option was to build a custom backpack tailored to the buggy and to center the design around a really big water bladder.\nVersion 1 was nothing but a fabric grocery bag tied to behind the buggy seat with a 3 liter Osprey water bladder inside. That was for the shakedown cruise of the new GT buggy in September 2022. Version 2 was a part of seat rebuild when the seat on my daughter’s Peter Lynn Comp buggy failed. Version 3, the proper prototype for the GT buggy, is what you see pictured in this book.\nI might never have made the book, but mine wasn’t the only GT-Race buggy to cross the Atlantic last Fall. Errol Hartbarger got the bug to buy a new GT buggy the same time I did. We ordered them the same week and Martin shipped the pair to the US together a few months later. I promised Errol I’d make him a backpack, too. I wrote 23 pages of notes in designing my backpack, but they were so poorly sequenced and error-filled I wasn’t sure I could execute a second one without goofing it up a few times on the way.\nThis book is my effort to turn those notes and the photographs I took during and after the build into a complete document describing how to build a backpack for a GT-Race R6 buggy like mine. I have included everything I did and learned in constructing the Version 3 backpack. My hope it that Errol’s backpack can be a little better design with fewer mistakes in the construction. I hope others find the book useful as well.\nPhilip Chase, March 2023"

While Martin designs and builds the buggy, the backpack was designed by Philip Chase, Errol Hartbarger, and Susan Chase.\n\n\n\nRight rear view of the backpack loaded with gear\n\n\nThe backpack is designed to provide both gear storage and accommodations for a three liter water bladder. It incorporates simple folded flap closures to provide easy access while minimizing dirt and water intrusion. It also provides a dirt-out feature on each of its two pouches to allow sand to fall away from the stored gear and be easily removed. A large pouch the full width of buggy’s back plate holds the water bladder while providing ample additional room for gear. A smaller pouch attached to the back of the main pouch is large enough to hold a large mobile phone.\n\n\n\nHose and bite valve magnetically affixed to the buggy frame\n\n\n This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

    "text": "2.1 Hose routing\nThe backpack provides routes out the top of the backpack for the water bladder’s hose. The routes are at the top of the backpack left and right of the center line. The two routes support the bladder’s option to route the hose up the left or right side of the bladder. Each route has a draw string to seal the opening tightly around the hose to reduce the risk of water and sand intrusion.\n\n\n\nRoute of the bladder’s hose out of the backpack\n\n\nThe free end of the hose needs to be readily available to the pilot. Osprey’s bladder hoses include a magnet that can be used to tether the bite-valve end of the hose with a second magnet. To coordinate with this, the buggy can be equipped with one or more magnets along the frame on the pilot’s preferred side for the hose.\n\n\n\nMagnets on the buggy frame help hold the hose and bite-valve in place"

    "text": "2.4 Resizing\nThe GT-Race R6 buggy is available in 3 sizes: small, medium, and large. The variation between the sizes is the width of the back plate and the dressing plate mounted on top of it. Each backplate can also be configured to a narrow or wide setting. The published dimension for each buggy is width between side rails surrounding the back plate when the back plate is set in the narrow position. Those widths are 40 cm, 43 cm, and 46 cm, respectively for the small, medium, and large buggies. The prototype backpack was designed to match the 40 cm width of the narrow setting of a small back plate. All of the diagrams and text assume this width. Where it is needed to resize the backpack for a larger buggy, those diagrams will be followed by a note like this:\n\nResizing note: The width dimension above should be tailored to the buggy size.

    "section": "5.1 Back panel",
    "text": "5.1 Back panel\nTo assemble the back panel of the backpack start by sewing the center hanger assembly. Use the 35 cm segment of 15mm webbing and two 15m stainless welded rings. Assemble them as shown in Figure 5.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Center hanger assembly\n\n\nThread the 20 cm of 1mm line through the loop in the 15mm webbing. fold the 1mm line in half. Zig-zag stitch the halves of the 1mm line together from about 3 cm below the webbing the tip of the folder line. While not shown in Figure 5.1, this line is visible in Figure 5.4\nThen prepare the hose exits for assembly by putting a 1 cm hem in the left and right edges of each of the four hose exit panels as shown in Figure 5.2.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Hemmed hose exit panel\n\n\nOn the top of the lower back panel and the bottom of the upper back panel, mark the vertical center line of each panel. Also mark 12.5 cm left and right of each panel. The 12.5cm mark will be the outer edge of each the tube exit. It’s easiest to mark the backside of the fabric, but you’ll need to see the 12.cm mark on the face of the fabric.\nWith one of the back panels face up, align a hose exit panel with the outer edge mark as shown in Figure 5.3 Stitch the hose exit panel to the back panel with a 1 cm straight-stitch hem. Be sure to be sure top back-stitch this seam. Stitch the hemmed edge with a zig-zag stitch. Repeat this these steps with the other hose exit on this back panel. Repeat the process with the other back panel.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Hose exit assembly to back panel\n\n\nWith the lower back panel face up, align the center hanger along the center line of the lower back panel. 2.5 cm of looped end of the center hanger should protrude beyond the edge the back panel. See Figure 5.4 for more detail. Sew the center hanger to the back panel 1 cm inboard of the back panel edge.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Attach the center hanger to the face of the lower back panel\n\n\nAlign the two back panels, face-to-face along the edge where the hose exist are attached. The hose exit panels should be hidden and aligned in two pairs. Sew a 1 cm straight-stitch hem to join the panels, but do not stitch across the hose exits. It’s OK to put one stitch on the hose exits, but stitching more than 3mm will narrow the opening. Also be sure to back-stitch left and right of the hose exits.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Back panel upper seam assembly\n\n\nNow fold the back panels together to expose the tube panels. Fold 2 cm of top one one hose exit panel towards its mate. Sew a straight-stitch hem at the bottom of the fold. Repeat this step with each of the other 3 hose exit panels. Make sure to stitch them separately, not to each other. These will form a pocket for a draw string.\nMark the middle of a 20 cm long 1mm cord. Thread the ends through the pockets you just made in the hose exit panels. Thread towards the middle of the back panel. Align the mid-line mark of the cord with the outer edge of the hose exit panels. Sew the outer edge of the hose exit panel from the joined back panels all the way to the top of the hose exit panels joining the panels and pinning the 1mm cord in one stitch line.\nStitch the in-board side of the hose exit panels from the joined back panels, but the lift the cord high in the pockets and stop just shy of the cord. Do not stitch the cord on this side. Each cord should function like a draw string to close the tube exit tightly.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Finish hose exits\n\n\nWith the sewing of the hose exits complete, thread each pair of cord ends through a cord lock. Tie the end of each pair with an over-hand knot to retain the cord lock.\nTrim a 1 cm square from each corner of the back panel assembly. Fold and hem all of the back panel edges.\nAlign the long hook strip to the bottom edge of the back panel, center it and sew all four edges to the back panel.\nMark the backside of the back panel 11 cm above the bottom edge. Attach one of the mesh panels to the along that marked line with a 1 cm hem above the marked line.\nTo attach the girth straps to the back panel, mark the face of the back panel at 6 cm and 32 cm below the upper seam. Still on the face, mark the vertical center line of the back panel. Also measure about 10 cm from the vertical center line. Mark the center line on the upper girth strap. Align the center line of the upper girth strap with center line of the back panel along the 6 cm mark. Stitch the central 20 cm of the strap to the back panel with a zig-zag stitch. Repeat this process for lower girth strap along the 32 cm mark. See Figure 5.7 for more detail.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Attach the girth straps to the lower back panel face\n\n\n\nResizing note: stitched length on the girth straps varies with buggy size. S:20, M:22, L:24\n\nAttach a pair of 15mm welded stainless steel rings to one end of each girth strip. Pass 2 cm of strap through the pair of rings and stitch the end to the strap with a 6 straight stitch passes.\nThe back panel’s flap closure requires two more pieces that require tricky alignment. Spread out the back panel face up placing the flap closure closest to you. Mark the diagonal construction lines shown in Figure 5.8. Thread one half of the plastic side-release buckle onto the 25cm piece of webbing. Use the diagonal construction lines to position the webbing on the panel. Stitch the webbing to the panel with a zig-zag stitch. Use the construction lines to position the 5cm hook strip. Stitch all four edges of the 5cm hook strip.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Align the flap closure fittings\n\n\n\nOption B note: The position of the closure fittings is not yet known for Option B."

Affix the circle of insignia cloth to the side plates.\nNote: A galvanic corrosion risks arises when affixing the magnet to the side plate because the aluminum of the Dibond plate and the nickel-plating of the magnet have different electric potentials. Seawater vastly accelerates this reaction. These magnets should be well-rinsed after any beach trip and checked for corrosion every other year. It’s unclear if rinsing can prevent damage to the Dibond plates."

Cinch the other hose exit to prevent intrusion of dirt or water. If needed, reconfigure the water bladder to match your preferred hose side.\nNote: Fill the water bladder before installing it in the backpack.\nLocate the dogbone, removing it from the webbing loop if needed. Lower the water bladder into the backpack. Thread the threading loop through the top center of the slide opening of the bladder. Pull the webbing loop through the center of the slide opening. Push the dogbone into the webbing loop to secure the bladder.\nLocate the end of the hose inside the backpack. Insert it into the connector on the bladder.\nThe finished product looks like Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.1\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: The dogbone in place\n\n\n\n\n\nWater bladder installed in the backpack.

If it doesn’t, compressed air or a leaf blower applied at the upper end should clear the remaining sand.\nIf sea water intruded into the backpack, it should be rinsed with a fresh water. Leave the backpack empty and open to dry if it is wet. It is made of waterproof fabric and will not dry if it is not left open and well-ventilated for several hours."

At each stitch line, measure from the unfinished bottom edge of the lower pocket panel and add 10mm to each height to allow for a 1 cm folded hem at the top of this panel.\nIt will be easier to mark the backside in pencil, but make sure you don’t get confused about which edge is the left edge and which edge is the bottom.\nConnect the dots along the descending slope of the lower pocket panel. Cut along the line to shape the panel. Cut out a 1 cm square from the top right corner of the panel, then hem the top and right edges of the panel.\n\n\n7.2.0.2 Main panel\nMark the main panel according to Figure 7.4. Mark the backside of the fabric (this is the face shown in that figure.) with pencil to locate the upper pocket, the adjustable wrench loop and the hook-and-loop strips. It’s not noted in Figure 7.4, but the loop strip on the face of the main panel should be 60 mm from the unfinished right edge.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Toolkit overview\n\n\nCut 2 cm squares from each corner of the main panel. Align the lower pocket panel with the main panel, folding a shirt tail hem over the lower pocket panel. Sew a the shirt tail hem in all four edges of the main panel, being sure to stitch the lower pocket panel in the the same seam.\n\n\n7.2.0.3 Upper pocket panel\nCut 1 cm squares from the each corner of the upper pocket panel. Hem all four edges of this panel.\nAlign the upper pocket panel according to Figure 7.4. Stitch the left, right and bottom edges to the main panel.\n\n\n7.2.0.4 Adjustable wrench loop\nCut 1 cm squares from the each corner of the adjustable wrench loop. Hem all four edges of this panel.\nAlign the adjustable wrench loop according to Figure 7.4. Stitch the left and right edges to the main panel.\n\n\n7.2.0.5 Hook-and-loop strips\nFlip the main panel face up, align the loop strip fuzzy side up, 15 cm above the finished bottom edge and 4 cm from the right edge. Stitch all four edges.\nAlign the hook strip at the same height as the loop strip, but hook side down. Overlap 2 cm of the hook strip with the right edge of the main panel. Stitch the edges of the overlapped portion of the hook strip.\n\n\n7.2.0.6 Pockets\nFlip the main panel to the standard orientation. Mark the position of each pocket stitch line. Straight stitch along each such line."
